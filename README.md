😊 Emotion Detection from Text
This project focuses on detecting human emotions from textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. Given a piece of text (like a sentence or a tweet), the model classifies it into an emotion such as happy, sad, anger, fear, surprise, etc.

🧠 Objective
To build an intelligent system that can understand human emotions from text using supervised machine learning models. This can be applied in:

Sentiment analysis tools

Customer feedback analysis

Mental health monitoring

Chatbots and virtual assistants

🧪 Models Used
The following models can be trained or evaluated in the project:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

LSTM (optional – if using deep learning)

🗂️ Dataset
Most commonly used dataset: Emotion Dataset from Kaggle or similar.

Typical format:

Text	Emotion
I’m feeling very happy today!	happy
I can’t believe this happened	surprise
This is so frustrating	anger

⚙️ Installation

🚀 How to Use
1. Training a Model
bash
Copy
Edit
python emotion_detection.py --mode train
2. Predicting Emotion for New Text
bash
Copy
